## Who am I

I'm a 22-year-old guy who tries his best to be a better person. I may look shy as hell, but I'm not. I just want to stay totally focused on this training to become the `BEST` Fullstack Developer.

## My surprising skills

- I'm able to make a right angle with my thumb.

- Not so surprising, but without training, I'm able to run something like 5km.

- 

## My favorites things in the Universe

- I really like driving, even with my Toyota Yaris, which is as old as me and beautiful. (My family says that I'm completely delusional when it's about my car; I don't understand why?)

- My (pocket) Husky named Irka, I'm kind of "gaga" with her.

- That's really "cliché," but my family, because without them, I would not be the man I am today.

## After BeCode

After BeCode, I would like to work remotely and travel as much as possible, maybe with a van or something like that. I'm not somebody who likes to stay static.

## My fears

I'm afraid of not finding an internship at the end, like my previous training, and wasting time.

## What I'm looking forward to

Like I said previously, I'm looking forward to traveling a lot because actually, without a job and money, I can't do anything.

## Why do you need me in your team

- I'm here to help, just ask me, for even if I look focus don't worry.
  
- I won't distract you, I will listen to my music while working and that's it.

- I will always do my best to give good ideas for our project.
