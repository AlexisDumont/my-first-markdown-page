## Who am I

I'm a 22 years old guy who try is best to be a better person. I look shy as f*ck but i'm not I just want to stay totally focus on this
training to become the `BEST` Fullstack Developer.

## My surprising skills

## My favorites things in the Universe

- I really like driving even with my as old as me beautiful Toyota Yaris.(My family says that I'm completely delusional when it's about my car i don't understand why?)

- My (pocket) Husky named Irka, I'm kind of "gaga" with her.

- That's really "cliché" but my family because without them I would not be the man I am today.

## After BeCode

After BeCode I would like to work remotely and travel the most possible maybe with a van or something like that. I'm not somebody who like stay static.

## My fears

I'm afraid of not finding a stage at the end like my previous training and waste time.

## What I'm looking forward to

Like I said prevously I'm looking forward to travel a lot because actually without job and money I can't do anything.

## Why did you need me in your team

- I'm here to help just ask me for even if I look focus don't worry.
  
- I won't distract you, I will listen to my music while working and that's it.

- I will always do my best to give good ideas for our project.
